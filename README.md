# Example Project: Sakib's Tea House
Welcome to my tea house! Browse and add to my collection with the help of components, props, state, forms, routes, and styling.

## Getting Started
This folder hosts the app's backend. If you want to change the data the frontend relies on, edit `db/seeds.json` and run `npm run seed`, followed by `npm run dev`.
